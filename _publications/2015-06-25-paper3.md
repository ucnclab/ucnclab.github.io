A series of NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Ho<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nano/micro-crystals with different crystal structures were synthesized <em>via</em> a hydrothermal method using citric acid as a chelating agent. The influences of NaF content, Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the crystal structure and shape of the as-synthesized NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small> crystals were systematically investigated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to report Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> doped α-NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Ho<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nanocrystals and the phase transformation by introducing Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> in NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small> crystals. As for Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> doped α-NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>, UC luminescence intensities of green emission (538 nm) and red emission (644 nm) in α-NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Ho<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nanocrystals with 20 mol% Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> doping are enhanced by 20 and 3.5 times compared to their Li<small><sup>+</sup></small>-free counterpart. As for Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> doped α/β-mixed NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>, with the increase of Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> content, the phase transforms from the α/β-mixed phase to hexagonal then to cubic. UC emissions of 538 nm and 644 nm in NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Ho<small><sup>3+</sup></small> crystals doped with 5 mol% Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> are enhanced by 26.5 and 23 times, respectively. Besides, it is found that with the higher temperature and prolonged time, the morphology of NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small> changes from nanoparticles to microtubes, resulting in the dramatic increase of UC emission intensity. The effects of Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the enhancement of UC emission intensity are discussed in detail. This study provides an effective and facile approach to obtain nano/micro-crystals with controllable structures and excellent optical properties.
