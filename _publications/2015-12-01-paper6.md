A Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup> co-doped NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> crystal was successfully grown by the Czochralski method. The crystal structure and lattice parameters were determined by the powder X-ray diffraction method. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the
crystal were investigated at room temperature. The refractive index of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> crystal was calculated according to the infrared-corrected Sellmeier equation. Based on the Judd-Ofelt theory, the intensity parameters &#937;<sub>
<i>t</i>
</sub> (<i>t</i> = 2, 4, 6) of
Ho<sup>3+</sup> were derived. The spontaneous transition probabilities, the fluorescent branching ratios and the radiative lifetimes of the main multiplets of Ho<sup>3+</sup> ion were calculated as well. The stimulated emission cross section for the transition from <sup>5</sup>
<i>I</i>
<sub>7</sub>
to <sup>5</sup>
<i>I</i>
<sub>8</sub> of Ho<sup>3+</sup> was calculated to be 1.2320 × 10<sup>&#8211;20</sup> cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> by the Füchtbauer-Ladenburg equation with the full width at half maximum of 117.8 nm.
