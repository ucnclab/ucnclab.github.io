In this paper, [NaGd$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$](MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystals with x = 0.005–0.05 were grown by Czochralski method at 950 ℃ for 10 hours and subsequently characterized by absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The intensity parameters of Nd$^{3+}$ were calculated by Judd-Ofelt theory, and the relationship between the parameters and Nd$^{3+}$ concentration was analyzed. The results show that with the increasing Nd$^{3+}$ concentration, the oscillator strength, stimulated emission cross-section, Ω$_t$ and spontaneous transition probability decrease slightly, while the fluorescence lifetime decreases significantly. However, the fluorescence branching ratio is almost unchanged with the increasing Nd$^{3+}$ concentration. The [NaGd$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$](MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystal with (x = 0.01) possesses the highest quantum efficiency of 88.98%, a good fluorescence line-width of 23 nm, a large value of σ$_{em}$·τ$_f$ up to 0.55 × 10$^{−22}$ cm$^2$·s and a stimulated emission cross-section up to 3.747 × 10$^{−19}$ cm$^2$ for the transition from $^4$F$_{3/2}$ to $^4$I$_{11/2}$ at 1064 nm. Test results indicate that [NaGd$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$](MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystals are an excellent gain media for the solid state laser system.
