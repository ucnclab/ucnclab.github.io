We propose a novel and efficient F<small><sup>−</sup></small> anion doping strategy for enhancing upconversion luminescence in upconversion nanophosphors. NaGd(MoO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nanophosphors doped with different F<small><sup>−</sup></small> contents are synthesized hydrothermally. Rietveld refinement results obtained from X-ray diffraction data indicate that the Gd–O bond length decreases and the O–Gd–O bond angle varies with increasing F<small><sup>−</sup></small> content, resulting in augmented local crystal field strength and distorted local site symmetry of the dopant lanthanide sites. Judd–Ofelt analysis suggests that the calculated radiative quantum efficiency of the <small><sup>4</sup></small>S<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> level and the radiative branching ratio of <small><sup>4</sup></small>S<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> → <small><sup>4</sup></small>I<small><sub>15/2</sub></small> transition in F<small><sup>−</sup></small>-doped NaGd(MoO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nanophosphors are much greater than those in F<small><sup>−</sup></small> anion-free samples. It is inferred that F<small><sup>−</sup></small> anion doping helps to reduce the nonradiative transition probabilities based on the luminescence dynamics. Rietveld refinement results and Judd–Ofelt analysis confirm jointly that doping of interstitial F<small><sup>−</sup></small> anions could enhance local crystal field strength with odd parity and modify site symmetry of the lanthanide activator ions, leading to enhanced radiative transitions and inhibited nonradiative transitions. A maximum of 17-fold enhancement of total emission intensity is found in NaGd(MoO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/F<small><sup>−</sup></small> nanophosphors compared with F<small><sup>−</sup></small> anion-free counterparts. The proposed F<small><sup>−</sup></small> anion doping strategy provides an alternative approach for enhancing upconversion luminescence efficiency and could be extended to other inorganic upconversion nanomaterials.
