As the emitters of quantum dots (QDs) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), QDs, which are responsible for the charge injection, charge transportation, and especially exciton recombination, play a significant role in QLEDs. With the crucial advances made in QDs, such as the advancement of synthetic method, the understanding of luminescence mechanisms and so on, QLEDs also demonstrate dramatical improvement. Until now, efficiencies of 30.9%, 28.7% and 21.9% have been achieved in red, green and blue devices, respectively. While in QLEDs, some issues are still to be solved, such as the imbalance of charge injection and exciton quenching processes (defect-assisted recombination, Auger recombination, energy transfer and exciton dissociation under a high electric field). In this review, we will provide an overview of recent advances in the study and understanding of the working mechanism of QLEDs and the exciton quenching mechanism of QDs in devices. Particular emphasis is placed on improving charge injection and suppressing exciton quenching. An in-depth understanding of this progress may help develop guidelines to direct QLEDâ€™s development.
