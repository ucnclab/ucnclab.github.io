β-NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>,Er<sup>3+</sup> upconversion (UC) microcrystals were prepared by a facile hydrothermal process with the assistance of ethylene diamine tertraacetic acid (EDTA). The β-NaGdF<sub>4</sub> UC microcrystal morphology was controlled by changing the doses of EDTA and NaF. Uniform hexagonal structure can be obtained at the 2 mmol EDTA and 9-10 mmol NaF. The UC emissions of β-NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>,Er<sup>3+</sup> microcrystals were tuned by the variation of Eu<sup>3+</sup> doping level (0%-5%), where the red/green intensity ratio decreased with the Eu<sup>3+</sup> concentration increase. It was found on the base of rate equations that with the Eu<sup>3+</sup> doping, the energy back transfer process <sup>2</sup>H<sub>11/2</sub>/<sup>4</sup>S<sub>3/2</sub> (Er<sup>3+</sup>) → <sup>4</sup>I<sub>13/2</sub> (Er<sup>3+</sup>) decreased. In addition, an energy-transfer process from <sup>4</sup>F<sub>7/2</sub> (Er<sup>3+</sup>) to <sup>5</sup>D<sub>1</sub> (Eu<sup>3+</sup>) and a cross relaxation process of <sup>7</sup>H<sub>9/2</sub> (Er<sup>3+</sup>) + <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> (Eu<sup>3+</sup>) → <sup>4</sup>F<sub>7/2</sub> (Er<sup>3+</sup>) + <sup>5</sup>D<sub>2</sub> (Eu<sup>3+</sup>) were proposed and verified by rate equations, which dominated the energy-transfer mechanism between Er<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup>, resulted in the spectra tuning of β-NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>,Er<sup>3+</sup>. The results suggested that the color tuning of β-NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>,Er<sup>3+</sup>,Eu<sup>3+</sup> UC microcrystals would have potential applications in such fields as flat-panel displays, solid-state lasers, and photovoltaics.
