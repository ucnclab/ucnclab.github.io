Multifunctional upconversion luminescent nanoheaters are realized based on NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals synthesized by surfactant-free solvothermal method. The structure, morphology and composition of the nanocrystals are analysed by XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, HRTEM and SAED techniques. Under 980 nm irradiation, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals emit blue luminescence with emission peaks located in the blue and near-infrared spectral regions. The electronic transition processes for the upconversion luminescence are discussed based on the excitation power-dependent upconversion luminescence, luminescent dynamics and Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> energy levels. The nanocrystals show efficient photothermal conversion after irradiated by 980 nm laser. The photothermal conversion slope efficiency for NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals irradiated by 980 nm laser for 10 s duration is 17.43 °C/W for 10 mol% Yb<sup>3+</sup> doping and 43.64 °C/W for 15 mol% Yb<sup>3+</sup> doping. Multifunctional luminescent nanoheater NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals exhibit both upconversion photoluminescence and photothermal conversion capabilities, and are promising candidates for temperature self-monitoring photothermal therapy or other biological applications.
