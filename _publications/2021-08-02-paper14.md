High-sensitivity optical imaging can be achieved through improving upconversion photoluminescence (UCPL) efficiency of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-enhanced excitation and emission. Herein, we report a type of UCPL nanoprobe, Au nanospheres assemblage@Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ln<sup>3+</sup> (Ln = Er, Ho, Tm), which exhibits emission enhancements from 46- to 96-fold as compared with its Au-free counterparts. The aggregation and interaction among Au nanospheres embedded inside the nanoprobe brings about three characteristic LSPR peaks in visible and near-infrared regions according to simulated and experimental absorption spectra, resulting in both excitation and emission fields simultaneously intensified all through the entire nanoprobe. We addressed a characteristic wavelength dependence on emission amplifications, which could be elucidated by a LSPR-enhanced UCPL mechanism and relevant rate equations that we addressed. The nanoprobe was verified to have a superior capability for optical bio-imaging with a negligible toxicity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This study realizes a synchronous double-field-enhanced upconversion of optical nanoprobe <i>in situ</i>, and may gain an insight into its mechanism underlying for LSPR-induced UCPL enhancement.
