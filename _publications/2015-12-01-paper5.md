A Yb$^{3+}$/Ho$^{3+}$ co-doped NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystal was successfully grown by the Czochralski method. The crystal structure and lattice parameters were determined by the powder X-ray diffraction method. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the crystal were investigated at room temperature. The refractive index of NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystal was calculated according to the infrared-corrected Sellmeier equation. Based on the Judd-Ofelt theory, the intensity parameters Ω$_t$ (t = 2, 4, 6) of Ho$^{3+}$ were derived. The spontaneous transition probabilities, the fluorescent branching ratios and the radiative lifetimes of the main multiplets of Ho$^{3+}$ ion were calculated as well. The stimulated emission cross section for the transition from $^5$I$_7$ to $^5$I$_8$ of Ho$^{3+}$ was calculated to be 1.2320×10$^{–20}$ cm$^{–2}$ by the Füchtbauer-Ladenburg equation with the full width at half maximum of 117.8 nm.
