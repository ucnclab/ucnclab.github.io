Uniform and well-crystallized tetragonal NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ nanocrystals with the morphology of nanocubes were synthesized via a modified hydrothermal synthesis method with oleic acid as complexing agent. The as-synthesized NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ nanocubes were characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction respectively. The side-length of the NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ nanocubes is about 100â€“150 nm. The SAED pattern indicates highly crystalline nature of the NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ nanocubes. The effect of Na$_2$MoO$_4$ contents on the formation of NaGd(MoO4)2 nanocrystals is investigated. A possible growth mechanism of NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ nanocubes is deduced based on time-dependent morphology evolution and XRD analysis. Down-shifting/upconversion photoluminescence properties of NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$: Eu$^{3+}$, Tb$^{3+}$ and Yb$^{3+}$/Er$^{3+}$ nanocubes are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the energy transfer mechanism for upconversion luminescence in NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$: Yb$^{3+}$/Er$^{3+}$ nanocubes is investigated on the basis of energy level scheme and the excitation power dependence of upconversion luminescence intensities.
