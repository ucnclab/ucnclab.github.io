Uniform and well-crystallized tetragonal NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals with the morphology of nanocubes were synthesized via a modified hydrothermal synthesis method with oleic acid as complexing agent. The as-synthesized NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocubes were characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction respectively. The side-length of the NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocubes is about 100â€“150 nm. The SAED pattern indicates highly crystalline nature of the NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocubes. The effect of Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> contents on the formation of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals is investigated. A possible growth mechanism of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocubes is deduced based on time-dependent morphology evolution and XRD analysis. Down-shifting/upconversion photoluminescence properties of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>: Eu<sup>3+</sup>, Tb<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup> nanocubes are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the energy transfer mechanism for upconversion luminescence in NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>: Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup> nanocubes is investigated on the basis of energy level scheme and the excitation power dependence of upconversion luminescence intensities.
