The Tm$^{3+}$/Ho$^{3+}$:NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystal was grown by Czochralski method. The optical characterizes and energy transfer process of Tm$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$: NaGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ crystal were studied. This crystal exhibits a large absorption cross-section at 796 nm and broad emission band around 2 Î¼m. The results indicate that the crystal may be regarded as a potential solid-state laser material.
