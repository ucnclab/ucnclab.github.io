Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doped NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Tm<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nano/micro-crystals with the enhanced upconversion (UC) emission were successfully prepared through a hydrothermal method with the assistance of citric acid. As for Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doped α-NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>, before the phase transformation (when Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> content ≤40 mol%), UC luminescence intensities in the red region from α-NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Tm<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nanocrystals doped with 40 mol% Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> are enhanced by 13 times compared to the Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small>-free sample. As for Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doped α/β-mixed NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>, with the increase of Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> content, the crystal structure transforms from the α/β-mixture to a pure hexagonal phase without a long reaction time or a high reaction temperature. Red UC emissions from NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Tm<small><sup>3+</sup></small> crystals with 60 mol% Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doping are enhanced by 9 times. The mechanisms of the enhanced UC emission and phase transformation by introducing Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> are discussed in detail. Furthermore, in order to obtain various structures of NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small> nano/micro-crystals before Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doping and demonstrate the advantages of Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doping, the effects of NaF content, reaction time and temperature on the crystal structure of Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small>-absent NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small> crystals are systematically studied. The results suggest that the intense red UC luminescence from Gd<small><sup>3+</sup></small> doped NaLuF<small><sub>4</sub></small>:Yb<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Er<small><sup>3+</sup></small>,Tm<small><sup>3+</sup></small> nano/micro-crystals may have potential applications in biological imaging and optoelectronic devices.
