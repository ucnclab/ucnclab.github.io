Gd3+ doped NaLuF$_4$:Yb$^{3+}$,Er$^{3+}$,Tm$^{3+}$ nano/micro-crystals with the enhanced upconversion (UC) emission were successfully prepared through a hydrothermal method with the assistance of citric acid. As for Gd$^{3+}$ doped α-NaLuF4, before the phase transformation (when Gd$^{3+}$ content ≤40 mol%), UC luminescence intensities in the red region from α-NaLuF$_4$:Yb$^{3+}$,Er$^{3+}$,Tm$^{3+}$ nanocrystals doped with 40 mol% Gd$^{3+}$ are enhanced by 13 times compared to the Gd$^{3+}$-free sample. As for Gd$^{3+}$ doped α/β-mixed NaLuF$_4$, with the increase of Gd$^{3+}$ content, the crystal structure transforms from the α/β-mixture to a pure hexagonal phase without a long reaction time or a high reaction temperature. Red UC emissions from NaLuF$_4$:Yb$^{3+}$,Er$^{3+}$,Tm$^{3+}$ crystals with 60 mol% Gd$^{3+}$ doping are enhanced by 9 times. The mechanisms of the enhanced UC emission and phase transformation by introducing Gd$^{3+}$ are discussed in detail. Furthermore, in order to obtain various structures of NaLuF4 nano/micro-crystals before Gd$^{3+}$ doping and demonstrate the advantages of Gd$^{3+}$ doping, the effects of NaF content, reaction time and temperature on the crystal structure of Gd$^{3+}$-absent NaLuF$_4$ crystals are systematically studied. The results suggest that the intense red UC luminescence from Gd$^{3+}$ doped NaLuF$_4$:Yb$^{3+}$,Er$^{3+}$,Tm$^{3+}$ nano/micro-crystals may have potential applications in biological imaging and optoelectronic devices.
