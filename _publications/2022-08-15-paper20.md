In this work, GdF<sub>3</sub> and NaGdF<sub>4</sub> nano/submicro-crystals are selectively synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method. By merely adjusting the amounts of sodium citrate added in the precursor solutions, GdF<sub>3</sub> and NaGdF<sub>4</sub> nano/submicro-particles with different upconversion emission colors and luminescent decay lifetimes can be controllably synthesized, which is confirmed by XRD, SEM and spectroscopic analyses. The particle sizes of NaGdF<sub>4</sub> nano/submicro-spheres decrease gradually from 230 to 100 nm with increasing Na<sub>3</sub>Cit dosages from 0.4 to 1.0 mmol. Under 980 nm laser excitation, GdF<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup> and NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup> nano/submicro-crystals exhibit yellow-green and orange upconversion luminescence with four intense emission bands. Due to surface quenching effects, the emission intensities of NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals decrease with decreasing particle sizes. NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals possess shorter decay times than GdF<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup>. The electronic transition processes for upconversion photoluminescence of Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Ho<sup>3+</sup> are further identified.
