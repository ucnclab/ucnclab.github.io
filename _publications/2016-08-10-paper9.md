Pure tetragonal phase, uniform and well-crystallized sodium gadolinium molybdate (NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) nanocrystals with diverse morphologies, e.g. nanocylinders, nanocubes and square nanoplates have been selectively synthesized <i>via</i> oleic acid-mediated hydrothermal method. The phase, structure, morphology and composition of the as-synthesized products are studied. Contents of both sodium molybdate and oleic acid of the precursor solutions are found to affect the morphologies of the products significantly and oleic acid plays a key role in the morphology-controlled synthesis of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals with diverse morphologies. Growth mechanism of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals is proposed based on time-dependent morphology evolution and X-ray diffraction analysis. Morphology-dependent down-shifting photoluminescence properties of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>: Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanocrystals and upconversion photoluminescence properties of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>: Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> nanoplates are investigated in detail. Charge transfer band in the down-shifting excitation spectra shows a slight blue-shift and the luminescence intensities and lifetimes of Eu<sup>3+</sup> are decreased gradually with the morphology of the nanocrystals varying from nanocubes to thin square nanoplates. Upconversion energy transfer mechanisms of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>: Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup>, Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> nanoplates are proposed based on the energy level scheme and power dependence of upconversion emissions. Thermometric properties of NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>: Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup> nanoplates are investigated and the maximum sensitivity is determined to be 0.01333 K<sup>−1</sup> at 285 K.
