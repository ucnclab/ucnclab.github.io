The Laboratory of Upconversion Luminescent Micro/Nanocrystals (Anming Li's Lab) was established and headed by A/Prof. Dr. Anming Li. The scientific research of the Laboratory's scientific work mainly focuses on the controllable synthesis of micro/nanocrystals, lanthanide upconversion photoluminescence and photothermal conversion, and the underlying electronic transition pathways and energy transfer mechanisms. The scientific research in the laboratory is funded by government grants (e.g., from the [National Natural Science Foundation of China](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/index.html), the [National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province](http://gdstc.gd.gov.cn/), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities - [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/), etc.)
