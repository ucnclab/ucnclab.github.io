After Dr. Li's coordination efforts and equipment procurement for nearly one year, the new laboratory rooms are constructed and open for use. 

The new address for the laboratory is Building 3 (Chongli Building), West Campus of Zhengzhou Normal University, Zhengzhou, China.

Looking forward to more scientific research achievements from the laboratory in the near future!
