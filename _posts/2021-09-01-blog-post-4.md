After Dr. Li's coordination efforts and equipment procurement for nearly a year, the establishment of the laboratory has been completed and the Laboratory of Upconversion Luminescent Micro/Nanocrystals has been put into use. Looking forward to more scientific research achievements in the laboratory in the near future!
