After Dr. Li's coordination efforts and equipment acquisition for more than one year, the new research rooms have been completed and open for use. 

The new address of the laboratory is 5th floor of Building 3 (Chongli Building), West Campus of Zhengzhou Normal University, Zhengzhou, China.

Looking forward to more scientific research achievements from the laboratory in the near future!
