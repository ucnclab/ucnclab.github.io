The International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) awarded Prof. Anming Li in recognition of the significant contribution of 6 patterns to the Powder Diffraction File - Release 2025. These powder XRD diffraction patterns and crystal structure data are six novel structural solid-solution nanocrystals  Na(Gd<sub><em>x</em></sub>La<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>)(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup> synthesized in our laboratory, and the related research results were published in the [*Journal of Luminescence*](publications/2021-paper16).
